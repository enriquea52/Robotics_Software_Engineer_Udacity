# Robotics_Software_Engineer_Udacity
A repository containing all the projects developed throughout the Robotics Software Engineer Nano-Degree plus a turtlebot laboratory.

Each project should be inside the `/catkin_ws/src/` directory in order to build the ROS evirionemnt with all the packages. Here a list of the Projects with a brief description:

- Project 1: This project consisted in building a housing environment in Gazebo for the other projects.

- Project 2: For this Project a simple differential robot was simulated using Gazebo and URDF, it was aimed to follow a white ball in the environemnt desgined in Project 1.

- Project 3: In this project `pgm_map_creator` ROS package was used for creating a map out of the Gazebo simulated environemnt of Project 1 and then localize the differential drive robot using the Monte Carlo (Particle Filter) Localization (MCL) Algorithm.

- Project 4: This project was about building a map of the environemnt built in Project 1 using the ROS package `RTABMAP` for implementing graph slam.

- Project 5: This Project consisted in creating a home-service robot that simulated picking-up and placing an object in RVIZ, implementing all the techniques and algorithms of the other projects.
